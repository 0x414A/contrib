# Emacs Major Mode for iRODS Rules

This Emacs Major Mode is designed for the iRODS 3.0 rule engine. The
3.0 rule engine is documented in the iRODS Wiki page "Changes and
Improvements to the Rule Language and Rule Engine" at
http://wiki.irods.org/index.php/Changes_and_Improvements_to_the_Rule_Language_and_the_Rule_Engine. The
following features are supported:

* Syntax Coloring
* Comment Handling

The iRODS distribution includes a directory of example rules within
iRODS/clients/icommands/test/rules3.0. These provide a good range of
examples that can be used for testing the mode.

## Acknowledgments

The implementation is based on the tutorials provided by Xah Lee on
the ErgoEmacs site at http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/elisp.html.
